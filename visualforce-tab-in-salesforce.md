# Visualforce Tab in Salesforce

### What is a Visualforce Page?

Salesforce applications can have complex, personalised user interfaces created by developers thanks to the powerful Visualforce foundation. It offers a tag-based markup language, an integrated development environment (IDE) and a collection of standard components for designing user interfaces. Pages requiring more customisation than what can be achieved with the standard Salesforce Lightning components and layouts may be created with great ease with Visualforce.

### What is the Visualforce Tab?

By using a Visualforce Tab, a Visualforce page may be embedded within the Salesforce interface and accessed straight from the main navigation. As part of their regular Salesforce process, users may now interact with custom applications and pages thanks to this connectivity.

### types of Visualforce Tabs:

1. **Custom Object Tabs**: These are linked to custom objects created in Salesforce. They allow users to view records from custom objects via a Visualforce page.
2. **Web Tabs**: These are used to display external web applications or websites within Salesforce. They can also display Visualforce pages.
3. **Visualforce Tabs**: Specifically designed to display Visualforce pages. These tabs can be tailored to show custom interfaces and applications built using Visualforce.
