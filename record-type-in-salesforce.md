# Record type in Salesforce

### What is Record Type in Salesforce?

In Salesforce, a record type is an organising and classification system for data inside Salesforce objects. For a specific kind of record, it specifies a collection of picklist values, page layouts, and business procedures. In essence, record kinds let businesses tailor data management and user experience according to various circumstances or standards.

### Use Case of Record Type:

One straightforward use case for record types in Salesforce is in managing leads. Imagine a company that receives leads from various sources like their website, events, and referrals. Here's how record types can help:

1. **Categorizing Leads**: The company creates different record types for each lead source, like "Website Inquiry," "Event Attendee," and "Referral."
2. **Customized Fields**: Each record type has its own set of fields tailored to capture relevant information based on the lead source.
3. **Specific Processes**: Different follow-up processes are initiated based on the lead source. For example, website inquiries might trigger an automated email response, while event attendees may prompt a follow-up call.
4. **Reporting Insights**: By categorizing leads, the company can track and analyze performance by source, helping them refine their marketing and sales strategies.

In essence, record types help organize leads effectively, ensuring each one receives the appropriate attention and follow-up based on where it originated.
