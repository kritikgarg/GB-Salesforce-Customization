### User

A “user” in Salesforce is an individual with a username and password that the organization grants permission to enter into the system to implement data entry, reporting and managing customer relations. Here’s a concise overview:

1. Identity and Access:
   * There are also usernames, which are more frequently likely to be e-mail addresses and passwords.
   * It follows role-based access control, based on profiles and permissions granted.
2. Roles and Permissions:
   * Roles: It is about defining how much and to what extent the data gathered can be seen and who is permitted to view it.
   * Profiles: Define the operation in terms of what a user is capable of doing: (e.g., object and field operations).
   * Permission Sets: superimpose more visibility privileges than profiling capabilities.
3. User Types:
   * Standard Users: Employees as per their routine use during general working hours.
   * Administrators: clients who have more authority to modify the configuration and appearance of a website.
   * Community Users: Salesforce communities are not only for internal users but also for external users.
4. Management:
   * As for users, they can be created, deactivated and updated by the application administrators.
