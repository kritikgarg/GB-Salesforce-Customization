# Salesforce flow

#### What is Salesforce flow?

Within the Salesforce platform, Salesforce Flow is a potent automation tool that lets users create and automate bespoke processes without knowing how to write code. Businesses can use it to automate tedious operations, improve productivity across departments, and streamline workflows. Administrators and business users can create and manage workflows with Salesforce Flow thanks to its visual UI.

#### What is Flow Builder?

Flow Builder is a visual automation tool within the Salesforce platform that enables users to design and create automated processes, also known as flows, without the need for coding. It provides a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to build complex workflows by arranging and connecting various elements.

#### How to create a Salesforce flow:

**Step 1: Navigate to Flow Builder**

1. Log in to your Salesforce org.
2. Click on the App Launcher (grid icon) and search for "Flow" or navigate to Setup > Process Automation > Flows.
3. Click on "New Flow" to start creating a new flow.

**Step 2: Choose Flow Type**

1. Select the appropriate flow type based on your requirements:
   * **Screen Flow**: Used for collecting user input through a series of screens.
   * **Auto-Launched Flow**: Runs in the background without user interaction, triggered by a process or automation.
   * **Flow with Lightning Component**: Integrates custom Lightning components into your flow.
   * **Schedule-Triggered Flow**: Scheduled to run at specific times or intervals.

**Step 3: Design Your Flow**

1. Drag and drop elements from the palette onto the canvas to design your flow. Common elements include:
   * **Start**: The entry point of your flow.
   * **Screen**: Displays a screen to collect user input.
   * **Record Update**: Updates records in Salesforce.
   * **Decision**: Branches the flow based on specified criteria.
   * **Assignment**: Assigns values to variables.
   * **Loop**: Iterates over a collection of records.
   * **Action**: Performs a specific action, such as sending an email or creating a record.
   * **Subflow**: Calls another flow from within the current flow.

**Step 4: Configure Flow Elements**

1. Double-click on each element to configure its properties:
   * For screens, define the fields to display and the variables to store user input.
   * For record updates, specify the object and fields to update, as well as any criteria for record selection.
   * For decisions, define the criteria for branching logic based on field values or other conditions.
   * For actions, configure the specific action to perform, such as sending an email or invoking an Apex method.

**Step 5: Add Logic and Conditions**

1. Use decision elements to add conditional logic to your flow. This allows you to route the flow based on user input or record criteria.

**Step 6: Test Your Flow**

1. Click on the "Debug" button to test your flow. This allows you to step through the flow and validate its behavior.
2. Use test data to simulate different scenarios and ensure your flow functions as expected.

**Step 7: Activate Your Flow**

1. Once you're satisfied with your flow, click on the "Activate" button to make it available for use.
2. You can activate your flow in the Sandbox environment for testing before deploying it to production.

**Step 8: Monitor and Iterate**

1. Monitor the performance of your flow and gather feedback from users.
2. Iterate on your flow based on feedback and changing requirements, making updates as needed to improve its effectiveness.
