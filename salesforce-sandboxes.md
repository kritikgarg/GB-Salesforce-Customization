# Salesforce Sandboxes

Setting up and managing Salesforce Sandboxes is a critical task for any Salesforce administrator or developer. This guide will walk you through the process of creating, refreshing, and deploying changes using Salesforce Sandboxes, ensuring you get the most out of these powerful tools.

**Creating a Salesforce Sandbox**

1. **Log in to Salesforce**: Log in to your Salesforce production environment with administrative privileges.
2. **Navigate to Setup**: Click on the gear icon in the top right corner and select "Setup."
3. **Access Sandbox Management**: In the Quick Find box, type "Sandboxes" and select "Sandboxes" from the menu.
4. **Create New Sandbox**:
   * Click the "New Sandbox" button.
   * Enter a name and description for your Sandbox.
   * Choose the type of Sandbox you need (Developer, Developer Pro, Partial Copy, or Full).
   * For Partial Copy and Full Sandboxes, you can define a Sandbox template to specify the data to be included.
   * Click "Create" to start the process. The time it takes to create the Sandbox will depend on its type and size.

**Refreshing a Salesforce Sandbox**

Refreshing a Sandbox updates it with the latest metadata and data from the production environment. This ensures that your testing environment stays current.

1. **Log in to Salesforce**: Log in to your Salesforce production environment.
2. **Navigate to Setup**: Click on the gear icon and select "Setup."
3. **Access Sandbox Management**: In the Quick Find box, type "Sandboxes" and select "Sandboxes" from the menu.
4. **Refresh Sandbox**:
   * Locate the Sandbox you want to refresh.
   * Click the "Refresh" link next to the Sandbox name.
   * Confirm your refresh settings and click "Refresh" to begin the process. Note that this will overwrite the existing Sandbox data and metadata.

**Deploying Changes from Sandbox to Production**

After developing and testing in a Sandbox, you need to deploy your changes to the production environment.

1. **Create Change Set**: In your Sandbox, go to "Setup" and search for "Outbound Change Sets."
   * Click "New" to create a new change set.
   * Add components (like custom objects, fields, Apex classes) to the change set.
   * Click "Upload" to send the change set to the production environment.
2. **Deploy Change Set**: Log in to your production environment.
   * Navigate to "Inbound Change Sets" in Setup.
   * Find the uploaded change set and click "Deploy."
   * Follow the prompts to validate and deploy the changes.
