# Junction Object

### What are Junction Objects?

In Salesforce, junction objects are created to establish many-to-many relationships between two different objects. For instance, consider "Projects" and "Employees" classes. A project can have multiple employees assigned to it, and an employee can work on multiple projects. To manage this, we use a junction object called "Project Assignment" to link projects and employees. This allows for easy mapping of values and captures the complex association between the two objects.

### How does the Junction object Work?

Junction objects leverage two master-detail relationships to establish connections between records. In our example, the "Project Assignment" object would have master-detail relationships with both the "Projects" and "Employees" objects. This setup allows you to create records in the junction object to represent individual assignments of employees to projects. Each record in the junction object links a specific project with a particular employee, creating a seamless many-to-many relationship.

### Creating a junction object in Salesforce

1. **Go to Setup**: Log in to Salesforce and navigate to Setup.
2. **Create Object**: Find "Objects" in the Quick Find box, click "Objects and Fields" > "Objects," then "New Custom Object."
3. **Define Properties**: Fill in basic info like Label, Name, and Data Type.
4. **Set Relationships**: Create two Master-Detail relationships with the objects you want to connect.
5. **Add Fields**: Include any necessary fields for your junction object.
6. **Save**: Click "Save" to create your junction object.
7. **Customize Layouts**: Tailor page layouts for ease of use.
8. **Set Security**: Control who can access and edit fields.
9. **Test**: Ensure everything works as expected in a sandbox environment.

### How to Query Junction Object in Apex?

```sql
List<Junction_Object__c> junctionRecords = [SELECT Id, Name, Related_Object__r.Name FROM Junction_Object__c WHERE Related_Object__c = :relatedObjectId];
```

This retrieves junction object records based on a related object's ID. Access fields from both the junction object and related objects in the query results. Adjust as needed for your requirements.
